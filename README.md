# GameFromTutorial
A project for the GameDev classes in TLU

This game is based on the tutorial from Zenva : https://academy.zenva.com/course/unity-city-builder-game/
I picked this tutorial for multiple reason, firstly because for the group project we are using building creation so I needed to know how it work and also I love strategy games so this was a nice introduction.

There were no real hard part, maybe just to follow a video tutorial is really boring because it's really slow.

I learn how to implement building creation using raycast and how to setup an UI

I've added multiples things to the game, I removed the grid placement now you can place your building everywhere, and because I like clean things I've added a really simple snap script that will allow to create building next to other easely I've also added a really simple map generation with some trees are rock and you can't build on them.
